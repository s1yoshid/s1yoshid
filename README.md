## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Shuusei! I'm currently a Systems Engineer @ LOGISTEED Solutions America.
My day-to-day work revolves around web development, but I'm just as passionate about hardware. In my spare time, I experiment with FPGAs and write HDL for fun, always looking for ways to bridge the gap between software and hardware!

## Skills

### Languages: Typescript, Java, SQL, Python, C++, Verilog, VHDL
### Tools: VS Code, Git, MySQL, Vivado
